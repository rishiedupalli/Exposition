\chapter*{Preface}

Calling this a book would be a grave injustice to books. It would be best defined as an encyclopedia or, better yet, as lecture notes. It is not recommended that one use this for learning competition math from the beginning and should be used primarily as a reference. As the primary use of whatever one had decided to call this is as a reference, we include little worked examples and offer practice problems with no solutions in an appendix sorted by category. Expect skipping around quite a bit; the topics are not sorted chronologically. We assume working knowledge of high school mathematics to the level of, optimistically, PreCalculus though one could get away with basic Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry.
